## SendERC


  This dapp has two primary functions.  On the homepage there will be information about the API, how to download bot software, etc.  There will also be a button that allows you to manually create a new Invoice using metamask.  

  1) creating an invoice



  2) the /invoice/#uuid# page
    - the UUID of the invoice will be used as part of the URL
    - A QR code will be displayed which uses EIP681 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-681)
    - see https://github.com/jibrelnetwork/ethereum-qr-code/blob/master/README.md
